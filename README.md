## Project description:

The app will help you track your emotional state during the day, see how your mood has changed over the course of a month and a year.

At the beginning, you need to choose one of three figures that reflects the day:
- 😃 Plus - the day went good
- 😐 Circle - the day went ok
- 😢 Minus - the day went not well

After a month, it will be possible to see that most days you felt great if there are more pluses on the calendar, or vice versa - bad if the calendar is filled with minuses, which may be a sign of approaching depression and the need to visit a therapist. Thus, the application helps to identify and trace patterns that affect your emotional background, to look at your life from a different, more realistic point of view.

After choosing a figure, you need to choose what feelings the past day has left. You can measure the level of worry, happiness, sadness and productivity from 0 to 10. After that, the selected figure is painted in colorful colors depending on the selected emotions and feelings.

You can share a completed day or month on Instagram by posting a story. When we share emotions with other people, we feel closer to them, we feel a sense of belonging.

If you regularly fill out Yourdays calendar, after a while you may develop the skill of self-understanding and emotional self-control. In addition, running such an application by itself makes your emotional state more stable and positive.
